How To Ues The xjc2016_G04_P2.c:
1.Open the Devc or other ide;
2.Run the xjc2016_G04_P2.c;
3.Run the xjc2016_G04_P2.exe file produced by the ide;
4.Requirments Of How To Input:
Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains 4 numbers:  
C​max​​ (≤100), always an even number, is the maximum capacity of each station; N (≤500),
 the total number of stations; S​p​​, the index of the problem station (the stations are 
numbered from 1 to N, and PBMC is represented by the vertex 0); and MM, the number of roads. 
The second line contains NN non-negative numbers C​i​​ (i=1,⋯,N) where each C​i​​ is 
the current number of bikes at S​i​​ respectively. Then M lines follow, each contains 
3 numbers: S​i​​, S​j​​, and T​ij​​ which describe the time T​ij​​ taken to move between stations 
S​i​​ and S​j​​. All the numbers in a line are separated by a space.
